          <i><h3>Cento</h3></i>
          <p>
            The Cento region draws inspiration from several overarching themes, blending nature with technology, history, exploration, and the environmental challenges posed by pollution. The region's connection to nature is evident in the naming of its towns, which are inspired by lesser-known berries that reduce the effectiveness of certain types, subtly pointing to the region’s ties with the natural world. Additionally, the design of Cento’s gyms reflects the surrounding environment, with each gym representing a specific aspect of nature in the area it’s located. The region itself is loosely based on California and the West Coast of the United States, but it has been creatively rotated and flipped to provide a fresh, unique perspective. Many of the local towns and cities are inspired by real-life locations, such as Passho City, which is modeled after downtown Sacramento, with its docks reflecting Oakland’s port culture. Yache City, influenced by Los Angeles, incorporates elements from nearby Reno and Las Vegas, blending technology and entertainment with a Pokéstar Studios branch and a fossil restoration lab. Smaller towns in Cento pay homage to historical references, further enriching the region’s depth. The region’s Pokémon and legends are also deeply rooted in Native American tribal myths and stories, creating a culturally rich backdrop. Together, these themes form a complex and immersive world where the battle between nature and technology, as well as the impact of human development, are central to the experience.
